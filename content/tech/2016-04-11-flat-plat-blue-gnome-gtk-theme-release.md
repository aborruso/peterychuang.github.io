*Update 22 October 2016: Flat-Plat-Blue for Gnome 3.22 is out*

## Flat-Plat-Blue Theme

Flat-Plat-Blue Theme is a Gnome Shell/GTK Theme forked from [Flat-Plat Theme](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat) with the following refinements:

* All coloured elements (e.g. check boxes, sliders, switches, etc) are changed into blue to provide a more consistent and comfortable visual experience;
* The top bar is now transparent;
* Open Sans is now the default font of the theme; and
* Other minor changes and fixes.

*(Scroll down for screenshots)*

I forked and modified the [Flat-Plat Theme](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat) for personal use, but I reckoned there were people out there who wanted a [colour scheme that was more comfortable to look at](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/issues/19), so I decided to put together the theme and open-source it. You are welcomed to fork it and make further modifications yourself.
