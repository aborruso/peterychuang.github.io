					<p>Peter Y. Chuang was born in Hong Kong. Growing up thinking he would become a concert pianist, he ended up studying Psychology and did some research on language comprehension. That was the time when he realised he would like to become a <a href ="//novelist.xyz">novelist</a> some day. After spending some time at the London School of Economics, he worked in finance and did some finance blogging before devoting his energy into writing novels.</p>
					<p>When he is not reading or writing, he listens to classical music. He uses Linux (current distro of choice: <a href="//archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>). Read more about his <a href="/tag/linux">Linux stuff</a>.</p>
					<p>He has a cat.</p>
